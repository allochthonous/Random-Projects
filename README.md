# Random Projects
Code for small coding projects that may be of interest to others, with relevent outputs where appropriate. Python unless stated otherwise.

### Radioactive decay simulations
Developed to explain concepts of random decay and different half lives in Intro Geology class. Code published generates frames which were then stitched into GIFs using ImageMagick.

### Antipodal Lithosphere Maps
Creating maps which answer the question: if you dug a hole to the other side of the world, would you end up at the bottom of the oceans, or on another continent?
